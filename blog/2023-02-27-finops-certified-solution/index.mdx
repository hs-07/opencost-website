It’s been a busy start to the year. We’re excited to announce that OpenCost is now a [FinOps Certified Solution](https://www.finops.org/certifications/finops-certified-solution/). The [FinOps Foundation](https://www.finops.org) has certified OpenCost because it delivers Kubernetes cloud cost monitoring, a specific part of cloud cost management. According to Vas Markanastasakis, Principal at the FinOps Foundation: "Our focus at the FinOps Foundation is helping advance the people and the practice of cloud financial management. OpenCost's vendor-neutral open source project shares that focus."  We look forward to helping more practitioners in the community and working with the FinOps Foundation to drive open standards.

There's even more news!

If you’re just starting out with OpenCost, or want to learn more about optimizing your Kubernetes cloud spend; check out our recent CNCF On-Demand Webinar: [Cloud Cost Monitoring with OpenCost and Kubernetes Optimization Strategies](https://community.cncf.io/events/details/cncf-cncf-online-programs-presents-cncf-on-demand-webinar-cloud-cost-monitoring-with-opencost-and-kubernetes-optimization-strategies/). This introductory video covers the basics of OpenCost as a project and a specification, and how to use OpenCost as the basis for further cloud-native optimization.

As the only FinOps and CNCF joint solution, we’re excited about the opportunity to expand our coverage into managing more external asset costs soon. Join the [OpenCost Working Group meetings](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/embed?src=c_c0f7q56e5eeod3j89bb320fvjg%40group.calendar.google.com&ctz=America%2FLos_Angeles) and get involved to learn more.

In case you missed it, [Grafana Labs has joined the OpenCost community](https://www.opencost.io/blog/grafana-labs) as users and contributors. Their developers have been active in performance and ease-of-use enhancements with the intention of helping make OpenCost the Kubernetes-standard for the cost observability stack. We’re looking forward to working with them!

And finally, if you’re going to be in Los Angeles March 9-12 be sure to join us at the [Southern California Linux Expo](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/20x/). Kubecost and OpenCost are both sponsoring the event, it’s the largest community open source conference in North America and we’re looking forward to the co-located [Kubernetes Community Day](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/20x/kubernetes-community-day) and [DevOpsDay LA](https://www.socallinuxexpo.org/scale/20x/events/devops-day-la). OpenCost Community Manager Matt Ray will be presenting [Kubernetes Cloud Cost Monitoring with OpenCost & Optimization Strategies](http://presentations/kubernetes-cloud-cost-monitoring-opencost-optimization-strategies), hope to see you there!
