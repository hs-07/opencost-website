The OpenCost UI is now available as a user-friendly interface for managing Kubernetes cloud costs. It allows users to easily monitor and visualize their cloud spend, making it easier to reduce Kubernetes costs while improving efficiency.

<!--truncate-->

To install the OpenCost UI you can use the container provided at (https://quay.io/repository/kubecost1/opencost-ui), which is now included in the standard [installation instructions](https://www.opencost.io/docs/install). The [opencost.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opencost/opencost/develop/kubernetes/opencost.yaml) has been updated to deploy the container as part of the pod and listen on port 9090.

You can upgrade or install fresh with
```
kubectl apply --namespace opencost -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/opencost/opencost/develop/kubernetes/opencost.yaml
```

Expose the UI locally on port 9090
```
$ kubectl port-forward --namespace opencost service/opencost 9003 9090
```
and you can access it on http://localhost:9090/

If you've been running OpenCost previously and storing your data in Prometheus, you should be able to see the UI with populated graphs like this:

Of course since OpenCost is fully open source, you can check out the [code on GitHub](https://github.com/opencost/opencost/tree/develop/ui). From there you can [build it from source](https://github.com/opencost/opencost/tree/develop/ui#readme), make your own updates, and share them back with the community.

Let us know what you think! We're here for any questions in the [#opencost](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C03D56FPD4G) channel on the [CNCF Slack](https://slack.cncf.io/) community.
